Server for NXChat

This Python script relays messages between NXChat and the OpenAI API. Please consult other resources for setting up your Python environment and installing required modules (e.g., openai).

Configure your API key
Before running the script, set your OpenAI key in the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable.

Allow your client’s IP
At the top of the script, add the IP address of your NEXTSTEP client (running NXChat) to the ALLOWED_IPS list.

How it works
The server takes each message sent by the client, forwards it to OpenAI, and then sends OpenAI’s response back to the client as a single payload.

Null-terminated messages
Every message sent to NXChat must end with a null character (\0). NXChat will only display a message once it receives this terminator.

Supported commands
In addition to plain user prompts, the server recognizes these commands:

/system <text>
 Sets the system prompt.

/recall n
 Fetches and displays the conversation from n steps ago.

/recall all
 Fetches and displays the entire conversation history.

/reset
 Backs up the conversation database and then clears all history.
