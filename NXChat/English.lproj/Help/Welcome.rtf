\f0\b0\fs24 \
NXChat is software that allows you to use AI assistants such as ChatGPT from within the NEXTSTEP environment.\
\
It consists of a pair of components: a server (a Python script) that runs on modern systems such as Linux, macOS, or Windows, and a client (this NXChat) that runs on NEXTSTEP.\
\
The client and server communicate via a TCP socket. The client sends prompts entered by the user, and the server relays them to ChatGPT using the OpenAI API. The response from ChatGPT is then sent back to the client. This enables the user to interact with ChatGPT through the GUI of NEXTSTEP.\

I hope this software proves useful in some way.\
